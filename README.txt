This is a readme file.

Computer Science is a good major since nowadays we can see computer software anywhere, it is an important part of our lives. I found it cool that different softwares work different for humans by coding differently. I've seen a professor made his computer could accept a phone call like a regular phone on school pc, and I can send a print comments to the lab room just from my computer by using putty. Those are really cool, and I really love to learn and know about how to do those. And I hope I can learn more reality stuffs of the softwares and more real company project experiences from this class.
